Usage:
You can use the structure below to create and add your own xmlrpc methods, or you can use the function below yourself (it's pretty powerful)


Some example arrays:
array( 1, $username, $password, $post_type, $category, $numberposts, $extra );

Get 10 most recently published posts:
array( 1, $username, $password, 'post', false, 10, false );

Get 10 most recently modified posts
array( 1, $username, $password, 'post', false, 10, array( 'orderby' => 'modified' ) );

Get 10 most recently modified posts in the sports category ($category can be either a slug or an ID)
array( 1, $username, $password, 'post', 'sports', 10, array( 'orderby' => 'modified' ) );

Get 10 most recently modified posts or pages
array( 1, $username, $password, array( 'post', 'page' ), false, 10, array( 'orderby' => 'modified' ) );

Search for posts in the sports category with the term Tom Brady in it
array( 1, $username, $password, 'post', 'sports', 10, array( 's' => 'Tom Brady' ) );

Basically, it accepts anything get_posts accepts (http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/query_posts#Parameters)
